    "* The oscillations of each individual component are not independent from each other, but **the modes are completely independent**: there is no trace of $q_1$ in the equation for $q_2$, and vice-versa. It means that if one initiates the coupled system in a funky way (\"funky\" as opposed to the clean symmetric and antisymmetric initialisations I did so far), and the coupled system does a weird dance of oscillations, the degree of complexity is actually finite: one mode has a certain amplitude and a certain phase, and the other mode has a certain amplitude, presumably different, and a certain phase shift with the first mode.

    "* When $n$ (we saw two, but it is more general) oscillators are coupled, the game is to turn the system into $n$ uncoupled oscillations.\n",
    "    Each equation you find by this procedure is meant to model the behaviour of one **normal mode**.\n",
    "* A **normal mode** is a mode of motion in which all components of the coupled system oscillate at the same frequency.\n",
    "    Each components may have phase shifts with respect to the others, and have different amplitudes of motion, but the frequencies have to be the same.\n",
    "* You can try clever changes of variables to retrieve the **normal modes** in terms of **normal coordinates** oscillating at **normal frequencies**.\n",
    "* You can also turn the coupled system of equations into a matrix equation and look for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the problem.\n",
    "    Each eigenvalue is the square of a normal frequency, and the associated eigenvector describes the \"shape\" of the oscillation.\n",
    "    This method may seem more tedious than the clever method at first, but it always works, even in complicated cases.\n",
    "* The eigenvalue/eigenvectors is systematic enough that it is easy to program on a computer.\n",
    "* Each mode is completely decoupled from the others.\n",
    "    You can see it because each modal ODE does not feature any other mode, or you can see it because the energy of each mode stays constant and does not exchange energy with the other modes, or you can use the language of linear algebra, and the orthogonality of eigenmodes.\n",
    "* Each mode behaves like an SHO: you can apply the same suite of procedures:\n",
    "    1. adopt-an-exponential,\n",
    "    2. find the natural frequencies, which we do when solving for eigenvalues,\n",
    "    3. Use initial conditions to find the amplitudes and phases (or equivalents) of the oscillation."
