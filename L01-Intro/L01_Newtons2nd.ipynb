    "## Newton's laws\n",
    "\n",
    "In PHY131 and PHY151/2 (*or equivalent, which I will omit from now on*), you saw how to use Newton's laws to solve basic mechanics problems. As a reminder, according to Morin (ยง3.1), Newton's three laws are\n",
    "\n",
    "> * **First law:** A body moves with constant velocity (which may be zero) unless acted on by a (net) force.\n",
    "> * **Second law:** The time rate of change of the momentum of a body equals the force acting on the body.\n",
    "> * **Third law:** For every force on one body, there is an equal and opposite force on another body.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first law allows us to introduce the concept of an inertial (or Galilean) frame of reference, i.e., a frame of references that moves with a constant velocity $\\vec v_I$... *Relative to other inertial frames of reference.* Which may seem a bit circular, so let's consider a conter-example: a rotating frame of reference. Consider Alice sitting on a pony on a Mary-go-round, Bob chillin on a bench nearby, and Nico on a nearby frozen pond. You see, Nico can't skate, so he fell and is now drifting on the ice with the velocity he had when he fell. Bob and Nico are both subjected to zero net forces: for Bob, the reaction of the bench and maybe ground perfectly balances any other forces the people are subjected to: weight, maybe strong bursts of wind. For Nico, let's neglect the friction due to the air and ice: again, reaction from the ground perfectly balances his weight, even his extra Covid-lbs (we assume that the ice is thick enough), and he will keep drifting at the same speed until he hits the edge. To Bob, Nico travels at constant velocity, and to Nico, Bob travels at an equal-and-opposite velocity. It is Alice who is the odd one out: to her, Bob and Nico appear to change their velocity all the time: they go left, away, right, closer... for no good reason, other than she is moving herself. To Bob and Nico, her velocity also changes all the time, being constant in the direction, tangential to her trajectory, but constantly changing her orientation. But the situations are not symmetric: Nico and Bob understand that her velocity keeps changing because she is *not* subjected to zero net forces: the reaction of the pony on her crotch keeps pulling her towards the centre of the Mary-go-round, and is only counterbalanced by a centrifugal acceleration that wants to ejects her outward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you just need to ask them to know that their situations are not equal: Bob and Nico don't feel any acceleration and Nico could close his eyes and pretend that he is the one not moving. Alice on the other hand will soon want to trow up if she does not get out soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: in this course, all our velocities will be much smaller than the speed of light. No relativity here!*\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is of course the darling of physics profs, because it is the law that allows us to solve simple and not-so-simple mechanical problems, and to design homework assignments and exams. I would feel silly, not to write it, so I will: if an object has a mass $m$ and velocity $\\vec v$ in an inertial frame of reference, and is subjected to $N$ forces $\\vec F_n$, $n=1\\dots N$, then we have\n",
